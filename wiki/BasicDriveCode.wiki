#summary Creating Basic Drive Code with Command Based Robot Template

= Basic Drive Code with Command Based Robot Template =

In this wiki entry we will be instructing you in how to create a command based project that will drive our 2011-2012 Rebound Rumble directly forward for 10 seconds. In this tutorial we are assuming that you have the current FRC netbeans plugins. 


= Step 0: Creating the Project =

Create a new project in netbeans. In the new project menu under FRC Java select CommandBasedRobotTemplateProject. 


= Step 1: Defining Electrical Constants =

Next thing we like to do when creating any robot code project is define all our electrical constants a class. 

For this projects sake we will be using these constants:
    * public static final int DriveLeftMaster = 2; 
    * public static final int DriveLeftSlave = 3;
    * public static final int DriveRightMaster = 5;
    * public static final int DriveRightSlave = 4;

These constants refer to the CAN ID of each drivetrain jaguar on our robot.
Please place them within the Robot Map Class.
